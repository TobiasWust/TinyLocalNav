# tiny local nav
my try to have a small script to load links with fetch to avoid whitescreens.

I have added it to my browsersnippets and can fire it on websites where I want to test the behaviour.

##usage
add script to any page with <script src="tln.js"></script> or as browser snippet.
local links will automatically be changed to use fetch.
